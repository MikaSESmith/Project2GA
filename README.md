## Project Description

Use this section to describe your final project and perhaps any links to relevant sites that help convey the concept and\or functionality.

## API

Use this section to include info about the API you have chosen and a code snippet of the data that it returns and is required for your project. 


```
{
  "status": "OK",
  "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2021 The New York Times Company. All Rights Reserved.",
  "response": {
    "docs": [
      {
        "abstract": "Patriotic films. History lessons. Mass weddings. The Chinese Communist Party is going into overdrive to celebrate its 100th birthday.",
        "web_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/19/world/asia/china-communist-party-anniversary.html",
        "snippet": "Patriotic films. History lessons. Mass weddings. The Chinese Communist Party is going into overdrive to celebrate its 100th birthday.",
        "lead_paragraph": "Movie theaters in China are being ordered to screen patriotic films with titles like “The Sacrifice” and “The Red Sun.” Elementary students in some cities are being told to create paintings and calligraphy extolling the “Chinese dream.” Buses and subways are broadcasting nationalistic messages about revolutionary heroes.",
```


## Wireframes

Upload images of wireframe to cloudinary and add the link here with a description of the specific wireframe. Also, define the the React components and the architectural design of your app.

### MVP/PostMVP - 5min

The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MPV and PostMVP.  Carefully decided what is placed into your MVP as the client will expect this functionality to be implemented upon project completion.  

#### MVP 
- Find and use external api 
- Render data on page 
- Allow user to be able to click on the categories and see current news articles.
- Create design using basic buttons and colors.

#### PostMVP 
- Allow users to be able to create profiles.
- Allow users to save articles.
- Allow users to share articles to their social media.
- Allow user's to customize their view from light to dark.

## Components
##### Writing out your components and its descriptions isn't a required part of the proposal but can be helpful.

Based on the initial logic defined in the previous sections try and breakdown the logic further into stateless/stateful components. 

| Component | Description | 
| --- | :---: |  
| App | This will make the initial data pull and include React Router| 
| Header | This will render the header include the nav | 
| Footer | This will render the header include the nav | 


Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all phases of the game.  Your estimates can then be used to evalute game possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before game must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add and additional hour or two to each component to play it safe. Also, put a gif at the top of your Readme before you pitch, and you'll get a panda prize.

| Component | Priority | Estimated Time | Time Invetsted | Actual Time |
| --- | :---: |  :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Create React App | H | 20 min| 20 min| 20 min |
| Choose API's and test for data | H | 10 min| 10 min | 10 min |
| Set up React Routing | 1 hr | 3 hr  |    
| Create hamburger nav | 1 hr |  5 hrs|  |
| Create search option | 2 hr | 16 hrs |  |
| Create "All News" & "Top Stories" in categories | 5 hr |  |  |
| Create "Suggested Topics" and those pages | 20 hr |  |   |

| Total | H | 29.5hrs|  |  |

## Additional Libraries
 Use this section to list all supporting libraries and thier role in the project such as Axios, ReactStrap, D3, etc. 
 D3 for webpages.

Tailwind CSS
Reactstrap for icons.

## Code Snippet

Use this section to include a brief code snippet of functionality that you are proud of an a brief description.  Code snippet should not be greater than 10 lines of code. 

 <div>
            <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
                <input type="text" placeholder="e.g. fashion" className="py-1 px-2 rounded-l-lg"  onChange={(e) => setText(e.target.value)}/>

                <button type="submit" className="bg-blue-400 py-1 px-2 rounded-r-lg text-white ">Search</button>
            </form>
        </div>
    )
}

Took me a while to get the understanding of the onClick, onChange features.
```
function reverse(string) {
	// here is the code to reverse a string of text
}
```
