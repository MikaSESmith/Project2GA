# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Project Description

Use this section to describe your final project and perhaps any links to relevant sites that help convey the concept and\or functionality.

## API

Use this section to include info about the API you have chosen and a code snippet of the data that it returns and is required for your project. 


```

  "status": "OK",
  "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2021 The New York Times Company. All Rights Reserved.",
  "response": {
    "docs": [
      {
        "abstract": "Patriotic films. History lessons. Mass weddings. The Chinese Communist Party is going into overdrive to celebrate its 100th birthday.",

        "lead_paragraph": "Movie theaters in China are being ordered to screen patriotic films with titles like “The Sacrifice” and “The Red Sun.” Elementary students in some cities are being told to create paintings and calligraphy extolling the “Chinese dream.” Buses and subways are broadcasting nationalistic messages about revolutionary heroes.",
```


## Wireframes

Upload images of wireframe to cloudinary and add the link here with a description of the specific wireframe. Also, define the the React components and the architectural design of your app.

### MVP/PostMVP - 5min

The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MPV and PostMVP.  Carefully decided what is placed into your MVP as the client will expect this functionality to be implemented upon project completion.  

#### MVP 
- Find and use external api 
- Render data on page 
- Allow user to be able to click on the categories and see current news articles.
- Create design using basic buttons and colors.

<!--App deployed to netlify, At least 5 components created,at least 2 routes,  successfully pulled data from api and rendered to screen, responsive styling targeting mobile and desktop  -->

#### PostMVP 
- Allow users to be able to create profiles.
- Allow users to save articles.
- Allow users to share articles to their social media.
- Allow user's to customize their view from light to dark.

## Components
##### Writing out your components and its descriptions isn't a required part of the proposal but can be helpful.

Based on the initial logic defined in the previous sections try and breakdown the logic further into stateless/stateful components. 

| Component | Description | 
| --- | :---: |  
| App | This will make the initial data pull and include React Router| 
| Header | This will render the header include the nav | 
| Footer | This will render the header include the nav | 


Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all phases of the game.  Your estimates can then be used to evalute game possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before game must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add and additional hour or two to each component to play it safe. Also, put a gif at the top of your Readme before you pitch, and you'll get a panda prize.

| Component | Priority | Estimated Time | Time Invetsted | Actual Time |
| --- | :---: |  :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Create React App | H | 20 min| 20 min| 20 min |
| Choose API's and test for data | H | 10 min| 10 min | 10 min |
| Set up React Routing | 1 hr |  3hr |    
| Create hamburger nav | 1 hr |  8hr|  |
| Create search option | 2 hr |  2hr|  |
| Create "All News" & "Top Stories" in categories | 5 hr |  |  |
| Create "Suggested Topics" and those pages | 20 hr |  |   |

| Total | H | 29.5hrs|  |  |

## Additional Libraries
 Use this section to list all supporting libraries and thier role in the project such as Axios, ReactStrap, D3, etc. 
 D3 for webpages.

 Canva for creating certain graphics & logo.
 Reactstrap for icons.

## Code Snippet

Use this section to include a brief code snippet of functionality that you are proud of an a brief description.  Code snippet should not be greater than 10 lines of code. 

<button type="submit" className="bg-blue-400 py-1 px-2 rounded-r-lg text-white ">Search</button>
        </form>
    </div>
)
```
function reverse(string) {
	// here is the code to reverse a string of text
}
```
